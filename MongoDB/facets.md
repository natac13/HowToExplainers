# Facet

A Facet is a way to _group_, _filter_, _analyze_... a collection of data. For example, say I am searching Amazon for camera lens, and want to view only lens where the price falls between $1100 and $1500. This is a facet and mongodb would support this funcionality with the aggregation pipeline using a \$groupBy or similar type stage.
